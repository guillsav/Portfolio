        I am a Web Developer and UI/UX Designer currently residing in the NYC
        greater area. As a Designer, I worked closely with Developer teams,
        which sparked my interest in learning Web Development and finding my
        niche. I am currently actively looking for a position, so feel free to
        contact me via email or Linkedin.
