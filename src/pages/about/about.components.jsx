    <AboutContainer>
        I am a Web Developer residing in the NYC Greater Area, eager to learn
        new technologies, and enjoy problem solving. My background use to be as
        a Web Designer, where I worked closely with Developers and found myself
        enjoying the technical aspect of building products for clients. This
        experience lead me to learn Web Development and technologies like HTML,
        CSS, Javascript, React, Nodejs etc... I am looking forward to combine my
        knowledge in Web Development and Web Design and help building products
        that makes a difference.
